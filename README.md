## ⚡ **Challenges We Faced**  

🕒 **Lack of Time-Stamped Data** – Some datasets (e.g., GeoDa) lacked temporal attributes, so we **simulated historical trends using interpolation techniques**.  
📈 **Optimizing AI Predictions** – Ensuring our model accurately captured **macroeconomic patterns without overfitting** was a challenge.  
💻 **Infrastructure Scaling** – We initially tested locally before **migrating to AWS for real-time data processing**.  
💰 **Expensive GPU Costs** – Originally planned for **multimodal AI training**, but pivoted to **fine-tuning GPT models** and creating **vector embeddings** for just **$3.67 on OpenAI**—a game-changing cost reduction!
